# GarageM8

Welcome to **GarageM8**, your personal digital garage assistant! This app is designed to help you keep track of your vehicles' general information, service history, and minor repairs, all in one place. GarageM8 is great for managing check-ups, quick fixes, and keeping your automotive records organized for easy access.

## ðŸš¨ Disclaimer

GarageM8 is **not** a replacement for official service records, legal documentation, or professional maintenance logs. While the app is a useful tool for tracking your personal records and making minor home fixes, it is intended for **convenience** and **personal use only**.

### What GarageM8 is For:
- Logging routine check-ups, small repairs, and basic maintenance tasks.
- Storing general information about your vehicles, like make, model, year, and more.
- Tracking minor service records like oil changes, tire rotations, and brake replacements.
- Helping with home repairs using built-in guides and tips.

### What GarageM8 is NOT For:
- **Official Service Records**: Always keep professional documentation from certified mechanics or dealerships.
- **Warranty Claims**: Vehicle manufacturers typically require authorized service records for any claims.
- **Major Repairs**: For major issues or manufacturer recalls, consult a professional mechanic.
- **Legal Documentation**: GarageM8 is not a substitute for proper paperwork, like registration, insurance, or proof of ownership.

## ðŸš— Keep Your Ride in Check, But Ride Safe!

GarageM8 helps you stay on top of the small stuff, but always rely on professionals for bigger issues. Your safety is important, and official records matter. Use this app to **complement**, not replace, your existing documentation.



## âš¡ Note on Electric Vehicles.

Please note that **electric vehicles** (EVs) may not receive 
the same level of support within GarageM8. EVs often require 
specialized maintenance and service that differs significantly 
from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Many EV 
components are high-voltage and are best handled by trained 
professionals (If you have an ebike you can do most of your stuff at home so we
have more support for your platform). As a result, GarageM8 focuses primarily on
conventional vehicles for most features. BUT Electric support will
grow bigger and bigger with time so have patience.
